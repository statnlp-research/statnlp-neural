positive lathan and diggs carry the film with their charisma , and both exhibit sharp comic timing that makes the more hackneyed elements of the film easier to digest .
negative despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like -LSB- seinfeld 's -RSB- revered tv show , about pretty much nothing .
negative there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust .
positive one-of-a-kind near-masterpiece .
positive in other words , it 's just another sports drama/character study . yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness . plus , like i already mentioned ... it 's robert duvall ! c'mon !

positive i 'm not a fan of the phrase ` life affirming ' because it usually means ` schmaltzy , ' but real women have curves truly is life affirming .

positive the cat 's meow marks a return to form for director peter bogdanovich ...
positive this rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you had n't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point .

positive i liked this film a lot ...
negative a mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic jackie chan to even younger audiences .

negative a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie -LSB- woody allen -RSB- has made in the last twenty years .
positive confounding because it solemnly advances a daringly preposterous thesis . acting can not be acted .
positive it 's crafty , energetic and smart -- the kid is sort of like a fourteen-year old ferris bueller .
negative parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone ... that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story 's core .

negative apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film .
negative partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless .
negative this is amusing for about three minutes .
positive neither quite a comedy nor a romance , more of an impish divertissement of themes that interest attal and gainsbourg -- they live together -- the film has a lot of charm .

positive ryosuke has created a wry , winning , if languidly paced , meditation on the meaning and value of family .
positive one of the most exciting action films to come out of china in recent years .
negative though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore .
negative as crimes go , writer-director michael kalesniko 's how to kill your neighbor 's dog is slight but unendurable .
positive aside from being the funniest movie of the year , simone , andrew niccol 's brilliant anti-hollywood satire , has a wickedly eccentric enchantment to it .

negative at least it 's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii .
negative the script has less spice than a rat burger and the rock 's fighting skills are more in line with steven seagal .
negative wimps out by going for that pg-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted .

negative brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism .

positive compelling as it is exotic , fast runner has a plot that rivals shakespeare for intrigue , treachery and murder .
negative overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste .
positive overall very good for what it 's trying to do .
positive takashi miike keeps pushing the envelope : ichi the killer
positive it 's easy to be cynical about documentaries in which underdogs beat the odds and the human spirit triumphs , but westbrook 's foundation and dalrymple 's film earn their uplift .

negative would 've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film 's predictable denouement . then nadia 's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all .

positive i 'd rather watch a rerun of the powerpuff girls
positive more romantic , more emotional and ultimately more satisfying than the teary-eyed original .

negative the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne 's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea ' and the george pal version of h . g . wells ' ` the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .

negative it 's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny .

negative this rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens ... or if it were subtler ... or if it had a sense of humor .
positive there 's back-stabbing , inter-racial desire and , most importantly , singing and dancing .
positive thumbs up to paxton for not falling into the hollywood trap and making a vanity project with nothing new to offer .
negative well before it 's over , beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels .
negative not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .
positive like the film 's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early - '80s suburbia , it 's significant without being overstated .
positive ray liotta and jason patric do some of their best work in their underwritten roles , but do n't be fooled : nobody deserves any prizes here .
negative an awful lot like one of -LSB- spears ' -RSB- music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it .

positive gorgeous scenes , masterful performances , but the sickly sweet gender normative narrative left an acrid test in this gourmet 's mouth .
positive the script is smart , not cloying .
negative it 's unfortunate that wallace , who wrote gibson 's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .
negative the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen .
negative consider the title 's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept .
negative every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet . for benigni it was n't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio . it might as well have been problem child iv .

positive the best film about baseball to hit theaters since field of dreams .

positive the lively appeal of the last kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy .

negative it 's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile .
negative ca n't get enough of libidinous young city dwellers ? try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes edward burns ' sidewalks of new york look like oscar wilde .
positive without resorting to camp or parody , haynes -LRB- like sirk , but differently -RRB- has transformed the rhetoric of hollywood melodrama into something provocative , rich , and strange .
negative it 's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins .

negative may cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists .
negative too slow , too long and too little happens .
negative it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there 's a little girl-on-girl action .
negative the story is predictable , the jokes are typical sandler fare , and the romance with ryder is puzzling .
positive both an admirable reconstruction of terrible events , and a fitting memorial to the dead of that day , and of the thousands thereafter .
negative ja rule and kurupt should have gotten to rap . it would have benefitted the dialogue .
positive very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience .
positive neatly constructed thriller .
positive it 's more enjoyable than i expected , though , and that 's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs . cinematic pratfalls given a working over . the cast is spot on and the mood is laid back .
positive -LSB- d -RSB- espite its familiar subject matter , ice age is consistently amusing and engrossing ...
positive manages to delight without much of a story .

positive exploits -LSB- headbanger -RSB- stereotypes in good fun , while adding a bit of heart and unsettling subject matter .

negative this feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
negative although based on a real-life person , john , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours .
positive hugh grant , who has a good line in charm , has never been more charming than in about a boy .
negative the smash 'em - up , crash 'em - up , shoot 'em - up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense .
negative what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess .
positive a miraculous movie , i 'm going home is so slight , yet overflows with wisdom and emotion .

negative nicolas cage is n't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie wo n't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career .
negative if you 're over 25 , have an iq over 90 , and have a driver 's license , you should be able to find better entertainment .
positive try as you might to scrutinize the ethics of kaufman 's approach , somehow it all comes together to create a very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment .

negative viewers of barney 's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it .
positive just as the recent argentine film son of the bride reminded us that a feel-good movie can still show real heart , time of favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain .

negative although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it 's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .
positive coy but exhilarating , with really solid performances by ving rhames and wesley snipes .
negative even the imaginative gore ca n't hide the musty scent of todd farmer 's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .
negative half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder ... would be more at home on a daytime television serial .
positive writer / director m . night shyamalan 's ability to pull together easily accessible stories that resonate with profundity is undeniable .
negative ` martin lawrence live ' is so self-pitying , i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show .

positive ... a gleefully grungy , hilariously wicked black comedy ...
positive twohy knows how to inflate the mundane into the scarifying , and gets full mileage out of the rolling of a stray barrel or the unexpected blast of a phonograph record .
negative whenever its story is n't bogged down by idiocy involving the cia and a lost u . s . satellite , hunter -- starring irwin and his american wife/colleague , terri -- is a movie children should enjoy .

negative the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie .
negative falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that are n't funny .
negative this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on .

positive the faithful will enjoy this sometimes wry adaptation of v . s . naipaul 's novel , but newcomers may find themselves stifling a yawn or two during the first hour .
positive ' ... both hokey and super-cool , and definitely not in a hurry , so sit back , relax and have a few laughs while the little ones get a fuzzy treat . '
negative the film 's overall mood and focus is interesting but constantly unfulfilling .
negative has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release .

positive atom egoyan has conjured up a multilayered work that tackles any number of fascinating issues
positive smart and taut .
negative the movie 's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach . but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ?

negative culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character .
negative before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , steven shainberg 's adaptation of mary gaitskill 's harrowing short story ... is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience .

negative kirshner and monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other . -LRB- kirshner wins , but it 's close . -RRB-
positive exciting documentary .
positive it 's a minor comedy that tries to balance sweetness with coarseness , while it paints a sad picture of the singles scene .
positive '' me without you '' is a probing examination of a female friendship set against a few dynamic decades .
negative a shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and rocawear clothing .
negative the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive .
positive an exhilarating serving of movie fluff .
positive trademark american triteness and simplicity are tossed out the window with the intelligent french drama that deftly explores the difficult relationship between a father and son .
negative the biggest problem with roger avary 's uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director 's cut glory , he 's made a film that 's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything .
positive in addition to hoffman 's powerful acting clinic , this is that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt , or will feel someday .
negative anthony hopkins ? big deal ! we 've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time .
negative i 'm just too bored to care .
positive the charm of the first movie is still there , and the story feels like the logical , unforced continuation of the careers of a pair of spy kids .
positive it 's clear that mehta simply wanted to update her beloved genre for the thousands of indians who fancy themselves too sophisticated for the cheese-laced spectacles that pack 'em in on the subcontinent .
positive like other great documentaries ... this goes after one truth -LRB- the ford administration 's complicity in tearing ` orphans ' from their mothers -RRB- and stumbles upon others even more compelling .
positive a very witty take on change , risk and romance , and the film uses humour to make its points about acceptance and growth .

negative troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal .
positive cool gadgets and creatures keep this fresh . not as good as the original , but what is ...
negative john mctiernan 's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison 's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga . it 's also stupider .
negative a cross between blow and boyz n the hood , this movie strives to be more , but does n't quite get there . good performances keep it from being a total rehash .
negative without non-stop techno or the existential overtones of a kieslowski morality tale , maelstr m is just another winter sleepers .
negative hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired .
positive highlights are the terrific performances by christopher plummer , as the prime villain , and nathan lane as vincent crummles , the eccentric theater company manager .
negative madonna has made herself over so often now , there 's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson 's nose .
negative the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat .
negative a ` girls gone wild ' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation is n't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers are n't removed and inquisitive enough for that .
positive a stunning and overwhelmingly cogent case for kissinger as a calculating war criminal .
positive bill morrison 's decasia is uncompromising , difficult and unbearably beautiful .
negative -LSB- carvey 's -RSB- characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark .
positive secret ballot is a funny , puzzling movie ambiguous enough to be engaging and oddly moving .
negative not only unfunny , but downright repellent .
positive serious and thoughtful .
positive the heightened symmetry of this new/old cinema paradiso makes the film a fuller experience , like an old friend haunted by the exigencies of time .
positive -LSB- kline 's -RSB- utterly convincing -- and deeply appealing -- as a noble teacher who embraces a strict moral code , and as a flawed human being who ca n't quite live up to it .
negative i approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise .

positive creepy , authentic and dark . this disturbing bio-pic is hard to forget .
positive although tender and touching , the movie would have benefited from a little more dramatic tension and some more editing .
negative no big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film .
negative director uwe boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback .
positive does n't do more than expand a tv show to movie length . however , it 's pleasant enough and its ecological , pro-wildlife sentiments are certainly welcome .
negative there 's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie .
negative it does n't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes . it still feels like a prison stretch .
negative you could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time .

negative two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity .

negative a wildly inconsistent emotional experience .
negative a bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance ...

negative it 's exactly what you 'd expect .
negative usually when i get this much syrup , i like pancakes to go with it .
negative while some of the camera work is interesting , the film 's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work .

positive a muted freak-out
negative comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions ... feel silly rather than plausible .
positive a charming and funny story of clashing cultures and a clashing mother/daughter relationship .
negative only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry .
negative ... unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept .
negative scorsese does n't give us a character worth giving a damn about .
negative what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical .
negative the story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin .

positive it pulls the rug out from under you , just when you 're ready to hate one character , or really sympathize with another character , something happens to send you off in different direction .
positive what bloody sunday lacks in clarity , it makes up for with a great , fiery passion .
negative an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn .
negative solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous .

positive an enormously entertaining movie , like nothing we 've ever seen before , and yet completely familiar .
negative despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still do n't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another .
negative bartlett 's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man 's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made .

negative a bravura exercise in emptiness .
positive a visual spectacle full of stunning images and effects .
negative the biggest problem with satin rouge is lilia herself . she 's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but does n't reveal an inner life .

negative a sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming-of-age tale .
positive disney has always been hit-or-miss when bringing beloved kids ' books to the screen ... tuck everlasting is a little of both .
negative a few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot has n't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists ' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun .
negative velocity represents everything wrong with `` independent film '' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the american filmmaking scene .
positive ali 's graduation from little screen to big is far less painful than his opening scene encounter with an over-amorous terrier .
positive fans of the animated wildlife adventure show will be in warthog heaven ; others need not necessarily apply .
negative even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other bullock and grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene . what should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test .

positive subversive , meditative , clinical and poetic , the piano teacher is a daring work of genius .
positive all the pieces fall together without much surprise , but little moments give it a boost .
positive edited and shot with a syncopated style mimicking the work of his subjects , pray turns the idea of the documentary on its head , making it rousing , invigorating fun lacking any mtv puffery .

negative -LSB- a -RSB- mess .
positive leigh is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema . he allows his cast members to make creative contributions to the story and dialogue . this method almost never fails him , and it works superbly here .
positive australia : land beyond time is an enjoyable big movie primarily because australia is a weirdly beautiful place .
negative while the transgressive trappings -LRB- especially the frank sex scenes -RRB- ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues 's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative .
negative to call the other side of heaven '' appalling '' would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be .
positive the film is a blunt indictment , part of a perhaps surreal campaign to bring kissinger to trial for crimes against humanity .
positive greengrass has delivered an undoubted stylistic tour-de-force , and has managed elements such as sound and cinematography with skill

negative those eternally devoted to the insanity of black will have an intermittently good time . feel free to go get popcorn whenever he 's not onscreen .
negative director elie chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you 're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ?
negative some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard ca n't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .
positive this is a visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce .
positive the picture uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life , but also acknowledging the places , and the people , from whence you came .
negative you may be galled that you 've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie .
negative while the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an american movie might demand , scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a hollywood production .
positive the way coppola professes his love for movies -- both colorful pop junk and the classics that unequivocally qualify as art -- is giddily entertaining .
positive eight crazy nights is a showcase for sandler 's many talents .
negative ... another example of how sandler is losing his touch .
negative lawrence should stick to his day job . he 's a better actor than a standup comedian .
negative whatever satire lucky break was aiming for , it certainly got lost in the '' soon-to-be-forgettable '' section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile . it 's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars

negative the premise of '' abandon '' holds promise , ... but its delivery is a complete mess .
negative quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ?
negative comes across as a fairly weak retooling .

positive what it lacks in originality it makes up for in intelligence and b-grade stylishness .
positive nicholson 's understated performance is wonderful . as warren he stumbles in search of all the emotions and life experiences he 's neglected over the years .
negative it 's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does n't offer any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid - '90s .

positive the film hinges on its performances , and both leads are up to the task .
negative for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it 's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking .
negative credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
positive many insightful moments .
positive chicago is sophisticated , brash , sardonic , completely joyful in its execution .

negative it 's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey .
negative while kids will probably eat the whole thing up , most adults will be way ahead of the plot .
positive it 's a demented kitsch mess -LRB- although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative -RRB- , but it 's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year .

positive scherfig , the writer-director , has made a film so unabashedly hopeful that it actually makes the heart soar . yes , soar .
negative while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary .
negative it 's impossible to even categorize this as a smutty guilty pleasure .
negative the sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset .

negative a horrible , 99-minute stink bomb .

negative an opportunity missed .
negative spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning .
positive argento , at only 26 , brings a youthful , out-to-change-the-world aggressiveness to the project , as if she 's cut open a vein and bled the raw film stock .

positive a muddle splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any scorsese has ever given us .
negative starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it -- but filmmaker yvan attal quickly writes himself into a corner .
positive all in all , it 's a pretty good execution of a story that 's a lot richer than the ones hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own .
negative hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity .
positive though not for everyone , the guys is a somber trip worth taking .
negative ... you can be forgiven for realizing that you 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already .

positive an action/thriller of the finest kind , evoking memories of day of the jackal , the french connection , and heat .
positive what makes the movie work to an admittedly limited extent is the commitment of two genuinely engaging performers . weaver and lapaglia are both excellent , in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk .
positive the best movie of its kind since ` brazil . ' lucas , take notes . this is how you use special effects .

positive an enthralling , entertaining feature .
positive where bowling for columbine is at its most valuable is in its examination of america 's culture of fear as a root cause of gun violence .
positive a solidly constructed , entertaining thriller that stops short of true inspiration .
negative there are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple does n't mean you have to check your brain at the door . the same should go for movie theaters .
negative the armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment .
positive as a belated nod to some neglected all-stars , standing in the shadows of motown is cultural history of the best kind : informative , revealing and richly entertaining .
negative the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge . these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future .
positive i admired it , particularly that unexpected downer of an ending .
negative this director 's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera .

positive surprisingly insightful
negative it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes .
negative dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm .
negative two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending .

positive if you can swallow its absurdities and crudities lagaan really is enormously good fun .
positive even better than the first one !
positive high on melodrama . but it 's emotionally engrossing , too , thanks to strong , credible performances from the whole cast .
negative this is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea -LRB- or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really -RRB- in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question ` why ? '
positive the two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire-breathing monsters barbecue with their breath ...

positive an experience so engrossing it is like being buried in a new environment .
positive it 's a remarkably solid and subtly satirical tour de force .
negative kenneth branagh 's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly british playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in los angeles .
positive ... with '' the bourne identity '' we return to the more traditional action genre .
negative instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kid-vid , we get an ugly , mean-spirited lashing out by an adult who 's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many barney videos .
negative sadly , hewitt 's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks .
positive for all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , blood work is a strong , character-oriented piece .
positive though it never rises to its full potential as a film , still offers a great deal of insight into the female condition and the timeless danger of emotions repressed .
positive without resorting to hyperbole , i can state that kissing jessica stein may be the best same-sex romance i have seen .
negative whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors .
negative the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .
negative if you 're really renting this you 're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you 're interested in anne geddes , john grisham , and thomas kincaid .
negative the irwins ' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts .
positive one of the very best movies ever made about the life of moviemaking .
negative no surprises .
negative after several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions , especially because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget .

positive the quirky and recessive charms of co-stars martin donovan and mary-louise parker help overcome the problematic script .
positive as quiet , patient and tenacious as mr . lopez himself , who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline .
positive massoud 's story is an epic , but also a tragedy , the record of a tenacious , humane fighter who was also the prisoner -LRB- and ultimately the victim -RRB- of history .
negative nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of elizabeth hurley 's breasts -- is authentic .
positive reassuring , retro uplifter .
negative while this one gets off with a good natured warning , future lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
negative how i killed my father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you 're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts .
positive the real triumphs in igby come from philippe , who makes oliver far more interesting than the character 's lines would suggest , and sarandon , who could n't be better as a cruel but weirdly likable wasp matron .
positive just about the best straight-up , old-school horror film of the last 15 years .
negative i 'm not saying that ice age does n't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there 's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life .
negative my precious new star wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag ...
positive though an important political documentary , this does not really make the case the kissinger should be tried as a war criminal .
negative it 's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long .
negative -LSB- a -RSB- slummer .
negative the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie 's power as a work of drama .
positive beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart . it really is a shame that more wo n't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet ` evelyn . '
positive the film is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer .
negative one of the more glaring signs of this movie 's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from ms . spears .

positive ... a fairly disposable yet still entertaining b picture .
negative too daft by half ... but supremely good natured .
negative -LSB- a -RSB- rather thinly-conceived movie .

positive a comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis .
negative this remake of lina wertmuller 's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero .
negative the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl .
negative unfortunately , as a writer , mr . montias is n't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor .
negative most of the action setups are incoherent .
positive one of those rare , exhilarating cinematic delights that gets even better in hindsight , as you mull over its every nuance in your mind .
negative it 's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name .
negative it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept .

positive beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling ... recreates the atmosphere of the crime expertly .
negative writer-director ritchie reduces wertmuller 's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon .
positive films are made of little moments . changing lanes tries for more . it does n't reach them , but the effort is gratefully received .
positive the movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but it displays something more important : respect for its flawed , crazy people .
positive earns its laughs from stock redneck ` types ' and from the many , many moments when we recognize even without the elizabethan prose , the play behind the thing .
positive i was amused and entertained by the unfolding of bielinsky 's cleverly constructed scenario , and greatly impressed by the skill of the actors involved in the enterprise .
negative formula 51 is so trite that even yu 's high-energy action stylings ca n't break through the stupor .
positive it is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth .
negative the original was n't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece !
negative haneke 's script -LRB- from elfriede jelinek 's novel -RRB- is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending .
positive a real movie , about real people , that gives us a rare glimpse into a culture most of us do n't know .
positive -LSB- grant 's -RSB- bumbling magic takes over the film , and it turns out to be another winning star vehicle .
positive it 's an experience in understanding a unique culture that is presented with universal appeal .
positive at its worst , the movie is pretty diverting ; the pity is that it rarely achieves its best .
negative ` the ch teau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
negative the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag .
positive those who love cinema paradiso will find the new scenes interesting , but few will find the movie improved .
negative the fourth in a series that i 'll bet most parents had thought -- hoped ! -- was a fad that had long since vanished .
positive the film reminds me of a vastly improved germanic version of my big fat greek wedding -- with better characters , some genuine quirkiness and at least a measure of style . the difference is that i truly enjoyed most of mostly martha while i ne
negative a soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for nba properties .
negative the film 's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments .
negative a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle .
negative a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip .
positive as lively an account as seinfeld is deadpan .
positive schepisi , aided by a cast that seems to include every top-notch british actor who did not appear in gosford park -LRB- as well as one , ms . mirren , who did -RRB- , has succeeded beyond all expectation .
positive when compared to the usual , more somber festival entries , davis ' highly personal brand of romantic comedy is a tart , smart breath of fresh air that stands out from the pack even if the picture itself is somewhat problematic .
positive like a less dizzily gorgeous companion to mr . wong 's in the mood for love -- very much a hong kong movie despite its mainland setting .
negative attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama . he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither .
positive it 's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity . but it 's hardly a necessary enterprise .
positive a gem , captured in the unhurried , low-key style favored by many directors of the iranian new wave .
positive steadfastly uncinematic but powerfully dramatic .
positive whereas oliver stone 's conspiracy thriller jfk was long , intricate , star-studded and visually flashy , interview with the assassin draws its considerable power from simplicity .
positive engrossing and affecting , if ultimately not quite satisfying .
negative its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up .
positive parts of the film feel a bit too much like an infomercial for ram dass 's latest book aimed at the boomer demographic . but mostly it 's a work that , with humor , warmth , and intelligence , captures a life interestingly lived .
positive definitely funny stuff , but it 's more of the ` laughing at ' variety than the ` laughing with . '
positive worse than ` silence of the lambs ' better than ` hannibal '
positive -LRB- danny huston gives -RRB- an astounding performance that deftly , gradually reveals a real human soul buried beneath a spellbinding serpent 's smirk .
positive this cheery , down-to-earth film is warm with the cozy feeling of relaxing around old friends .
positive it 's got some pretentious eye-rolling moments and it did n't entirely grab me , but there 's stuff here to like .
positive by the time it ends in a rush of sequins , flashbulbs , blaring brass and back-stabbing babes , it has said plenty about how show business has infiltrated every corner of society -- and not always for the better .
negative sheridan is painfully bad , a fourth-rate jim carrey who does n't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb .
negative makes 98 minutes feel like three hours .
negative the parts are better than the whole -LRB- bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york -RRB- .
positive as unseemly as its title suggests .
negative you come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that 's at the center of the story .
negative you 'll just have your head in your hands wondering why lee 's character did n't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery .
negative we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they 'll wind up together , and michele 's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest .
negative staggeringly dreadful romance .
positive what 's surprising about full frontal is that despite its overt self-awareness , parts of the movie still manage to break past the artifice and thoroughly engage you .
negative some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity .
negative the whole thing plays like a tired tyco ad .
negative tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar .
negative it 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .
negative ... blade ii is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves .
negative no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story .
negative a dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the animal planet documentary series , crocodile hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring .
positive with ` bowling for columbine , ' michael moore gives us the perfect starting point for a national conversation about guns , violence , and fear .
negative a wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prep-school kid with a mrs . robinson complex founders on its own preciousness -- and squanders its beautiful women .
positive the film will appeal to discovery channel fans and will surely widen the perspective of those of us who see the continent through rose-colored glasses .
negative some episodes work , some do n't .
positive both a detective story and a romance spiced with the intrigue of academic skullduggery and politics .
negative -LSB- janey -RSB- forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies .
negative even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency .
negative manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney ... take your pick . all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new .
negative upper west sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute .
positive wonder , hope and magic can never escape the heart of the boy when the right movie comes along , especially if it begins with the name of star wars
positive lejos del para so es al mismo tiempo una fiesta para los ojos y o dos y un movilizador cuadro de personajes enfrentados a sus propios deseos , miedos y prejuicios .
negative i hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of high art .
negative when the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you 'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence .
positive playing a role of almost bergmanesque intensity ... bisset is both convincing and radiant .
positive one of the most slyly exquisite anti-adult movies ever made .
negative so brisk is wang 's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe .
negative fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent .
negative despite the pyrotechnics , narc is strictly by the book .
negative who , exactly , is fighting whom here ? ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze .
negative a movie to forget
positive a certain sexiness underlines even the dullest tangents .
negative the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it 's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list .
negative ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film .
negative a handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc .
negative in this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian .
negative are monsters born , or made ?
negative the concept is a hoot . the trailer is a riot . the movie is a dud .
negative the film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film .
positive while the path may be familiar , first-time director denzel washington and a top-notch cast manage to keep things interesting .
negative director dirk shafer and co-writer greg hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama .
negative murphy and wilson actually make a pretty good team ... but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote .
negative best described as i know what you did last winter .
positive ... a true delight .
positive -LSB- jeff 's -RSB- gorgeous , fluid compositions , underlined by neil finn and edmund mcwilliams 's melancholy music , are charged with metaphor , but rarely easy , obvious or self-indulgent .
positive a painfully funny ode to bad behavior .
positive speaks eloquently about the symbiotic relationship between art and life .

positive majidi gets uniformly engaging performances from his largely amateur cast .
positive beautifully directed and convincingly acted .
positive bogdanovich tantalizes by offering a peep show into the lives of the era 's creme de la celluloid .
negative a movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist 's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms .
positive -LSB- drumline -RSB- is entertaining for what it does , and admirable for what it does n't do .
positive evokes the 19th century with a subtlety that is an object lesson in period filmmaking .
negative despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , the man who wrote rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this .
negative the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone .
negative it is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by southern blacks as distilled through a caucasian perspective .
negative spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative .
positive it 's a glorious groove that leaves you wanting more .

positive it will break your heart many times over .
negative muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for kevin costner .
negative an annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere .

positive here 's a british flick gleefully unconcerned with plausibility , yet just as determined to entertain you .
positive -LSB- moore 's -RSB- better at fingering problems than finding solutions . but though he only scratches the surface , at least he provides a strong itch to explore more .
positive -LSB- anderson -RSB- uses a hit-or-miss aesthetic that hits often enough to keep the film entertaining even if none of it makes a lick of sense .
negative arnold 's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces .
positive works because , for the most part , it avoids the stupid cliches and formulaic potholes that befall its brethren .
positive tim allen is great in his role but never hogs the scenes from his fellow cast , as there are plenty of laughs and good lines for everyone in this comedy .
positive the film 's 45-minute running time stops shy of overkill , though viewers may be more exhausted than the athletes onscreen .
positive hilarious , touching and wonderfully dyspeptic .
negative one of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch .
positive conceptually brilliant ... plays like a living-room war of the worlds , gaining most of its unsettling force from the suggested and the unknown .
positive if the man from elysian fields is doomed by its smallness , it is also elevated by it -- the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you 're one of the lucky few who sought it out .

negative this is not one of the movies you 'd want to watch if you only had a week to live .
positive much has been written about those years when the psychedelic '60s grooved over into the gay '70s , but words do n't really do the era justice . you have to see it .
negative the action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory .
negative is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ?
positive '' the emperor 's new clothes '' begins with a simple plan ... . well , at least that 's the plan .
negative kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business .
positive what could have become just another cautionary fable is allowed to play out as a clever , charming tale as pleasantly in its own way as its self-dramatizing characters .
positive by not averting his eyes , solondz forces us to consider the unthinkable , the unacceptable , the unmentionable .
negative with the exception of mccoist , the players do n't have a clue on the park . the acting is n't much better .
positive just offbeat enough to keep you interested without coming close to bowling you over .
negative the whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey ... -LSB- it -RSB- comes off like a hallmark commercial .
negative donovan ... squanders his main asset , jackie chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences .
positive perhaps the grossest movie ever made . funny , though .
positive is this love or is it masochism ? binoche makes it interesting trying to find out .
negative all analyze that proves is that there is really only one movie 's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise .
negative nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy .
positive ... a well-observed and disturbing little movie
negative a film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy hollywood caper flick .
positive a sensitive , cultivated treatment of greene 's work as well as a remarkably faithful one .
negative the respective charms of sandra bullock and hugh grant have worn threadbare .
positive ... works on some levels and is certainly worth seeing at least once .
negative derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone .
positive jacquot 's strategy allows his cast the benefit of being able to give full performances ... while demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself .
negative the script by vincent r . nebrida ... tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot .
negative some actors steal scenes . tom green just gives them a bad odor . this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he 's the most obvious one .
positive the powerpuff girls arrive on the big screen with their super-powers , their super-simple animation and their super-dooper-adorability intact .
positive twenty years after its first release , e . t . remains the most wondrous of all hollywood fantasies -- and the apex of steven spielberg 's misunderstood career .
negative although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful .
negative the rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey .
negative it 's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland .
positive -LSB- an -RSB- hilarious romantic comedy .
positive a strong and confident work which works so well for the first 89 minutes , but ends so horrendously confusing in the final two
positive if s & m seems like a strange route to true love , maybe it is , but it 's to this film 's -LRB- and its makers ' -RRB- credit that we believe that that 's exactly what these two people need to find each other -- and themselves .
negative the problem is not that it 's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material .
negative the characters are never more than sketches ... which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach .
positive got a david lynch jones ? then you 'd do well to check this one out because it 's straight up twin peaks action ...
positive wang xiaoshuai directs this intricately structured and well-realized drama that presents a fascinating glimpse of urban life and the class warfare that embroils two young men .
positive psychologically revealing .

positive a pleasurably jacked-up piece of action moviemaking .
negative the ending does n't work ... but most of the movie works so well i 'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong .

negative they threw loads of money at an idea that should 've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans .

negative laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany .

positive -LSB- stephen -RSB- earnhart 's film is more about the optimism of a group of people who are struggling to give themselves a better lot in life than the ones they currently have .
negative should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor .

negative wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time .

positive the movie is n't always easy to look at . but if it is indeed a duty of art to reflect life , than leigh has created a masterful piece of artistry right here .
positive tsai has a well-deserved reputation as one of the cinema world 's great visual stylists , and in this film , every shot enhances the excellent performances .
positive if there 's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs , i think it 's in projects like the -LRB- unfortunately r-rated -RRB- paid .
negative while benigni -LRB- who stars and co-wrote -RRB- seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that .

positive the magic -LRB- and original running time -RRB- of ace japanimator hayao miyazaki 's spirited away survives intact in bv 's re-voiced version .
positive a thoroughly entertaining comedy that uses grant 's own twist of acidity to prevent itself from succumbing to its own bathos .

positive this is a startling film that gives you a fascinating , albeit depressing view of iranian rural life close to the iraqi border .

positive kiarostami has crafted a deceptively casual ode to children and managed to convey a tiny sense of hope .
positive a fascinating , bombshell documentary that should shame americans , regardless of whether or not ultimate blame finally lies with kissinger . should be required viewing for civics classes and would-be public servants alike .

positive would be an unendurable viewing experience for this ultra-provincial new yorker if 26-year-old reese witherspoon were not on hand to inject her pure fantasy character , melanie carmichael , with a massive infusion of old-fashioned hollywood magic .
negative though it draws several decent laughs , it 's low-cal woody at best .

negative blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood 's dirty harry period .

positive it 's a familiar story , but one that is presented with great sympathy and intelligence .

positive fresnadillo has something serious to say about the ways in which extravagant chance can distort our perspective and throw us off the path of good sense .
positive a charming but slight comedy .
negative ` sophisticated ' viewers who refuse to admit that they do n't like it will likely call it ` challenging ' to their fellow sophisticates .

positive despite the long running time , the pace never feels slack -- there 's no scene that screams '' bathroom break ! ''
negative the story itself is actually quite vapid .
positive what -LSB- denis -RSB- accomplishes in his chilling , unnerving film is a double portrait of two young women whose lives were as claustrophic , suffocating and chilly as the attics to which they were inevitably consigned .
negative fear dot com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds .
negative '' not really as bad as you might think ! ''
negative it 's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic .
positive shanghai ghetto , much stranger than any fiction , brings this unknown slice of history affectingly to life .

positive the vistas are sweeping and the acting is far from painful .
positive the movie is full of fine performances , led by josef bierbichler as brecht and monica bleibtreu as helene weigel , his wife .
negative ms . phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either esther 's initial anomie or her eventual awakening .
negative if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta .
negative to the filmmakers , ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there 's no indication that he 's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit .
negative it 's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni .
negative we ca n't accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie . unfortunately , we 'd prefer a simple misfire .
positive a genuinely funny ensemble comedy that also asks its audience -- in a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way -- to consider what we value in our daily lives .
negative an enigmatic film that 's too clever for its own good , it 's a conundrum not worth solving .
negative passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes . for me , this opera is n't a favorite , so it 's a long time before the fat lady sings .
positive frailty is n't as gory or explicit . but in its child-centered , claustrophobic context , it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing .
positive this road movie gives you emotional whiplash , and you 'll be glad you went along for the ride .
positive it 's always fascinating to watch marker the essayist at work .
negative there is no pleasure in watching a child suffer . just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame .
positive witty , contemplative , and sublimely beautiful .
positive a model of what films like this should be like .
positive i know i should n't have laughed , but hey , those farts got to my inner nine-year-old .
positive worth the effort to watch .
negative sade achieves the near-impossible : it turns the marquis de sade into a dullard .
negative deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness .
negative bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side .
positive the movie is one of the best examples of artful large format filmmaking you are likely to see anytime soon .
positive the cast is top-notch and i predict there will be plenty of female audience members drooling over michael idemoto as michael .
positive -LSB- westbrook -RSB- makes a wonderful subject for the camera .
positive despite the predictable parent vs . child coming-of-age theme , first-class , natural acting and a look at '' the real americans '' make this a charmer .
positive i have a new favorite musical -- and i 'm not even a fan of the genre
positive '' the ring '' is pretty much an english-language copy of the film that inspired it , and it carries the same strengths and flaws .
negative the screenplay sabotages the movie 's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable .
positive everything you loved about it in 1982 is still there , for everybody who wants to be a kid again , or show it to their own kids .
negative despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director peter mattei 's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy .

positive ... gripping and handsome execution , -LRB- but -RRB- there is n't much about k-19 that 's unique or memorable .
negative the inevitable double - and triple-crosses arise , but the only drama is in waiting to hear how john malkovich 's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line .
negative the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull .
positive about the best thing you could say about narc is that it 's a rock-solid little genre picture . whether you like it or not is basically a matter of taste .
positive a manically generous christmas vaudeville .
negative the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there 's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .
positive the film is darkly funny in its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work .
positive -LSB- clooney 's -RSB- debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined , but it has a tremendous , offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him , especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh .
positive the writing is clever and the cast is appealing .
negative ... -LRB- like -RRB- channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie .
positive if there 's nothing fresh about wannabes , which was written by mr . demeo , who produced and directed the film with charles a . addessi , much of the time the movie feels authentic .
positive more good than great but freeman and judd make it work .
positive a brain twister , less a movie-movie than a funny and weird meditation on hollywood , success , artistic integrity and intellectual bankruptcy .
negative an awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating .
negative there 's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but brooms is n't it .
positive star wars is back in a major way .
positive some movies suck you in despite their flaws , and heaven is one such beast .
positive tsai has managed to create an underplayed melodrama about family dynamics and dysfunction that harks back to the spare , unchecked heartache of yasujiro ozu .
positive it 's a very valuable film ...
positive ice age wo n't drop your jaw , but it will warm your heart , and i 'm giving it a strong thumbs up .
positive together -LSB- time out and human resources -RSB- establish mr . cantet as france 's foremost cinematic poet of the workplace .

negative the elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat .

positive if signs is a good film , and it is , the essence of a great one is in there somewhere .
negative the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters .
positive parker can not sustain the buoyant energy level of the film 's city beginnings into its country conclusion
positive talk to her is so darned assured , we have absolutely no idea who the main characters are until the film is well under way -- and yet it 's hard to stop watching .
negative wobbly senegalese updating of '' carmen '' which is best for the stunning star turn by djeinaba diop gai
positive more timely than its director could ever have dreamed , this quietly lyrical tale probes the ambiguous welcome extended by iran to the afghani refugees who streamed across its borders , desperate for work and food .
positive at times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated -LRB- depending upon where you live -RRB- , ignorant fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two .
positive gloriously straight from the vagina .
positive a forceful drama of an alienated executive who re-invents himself .
negative kidman is really the only thing that 's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth -LRB- mojo -RRB- that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world .
positive martin and barbara are complex characters -- sometimes tender , sometimes angry -- and the delicate performances by sven wollter and viveka seldahl make their hopes and frustrations vivid .
negative true to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at .
positive a naturally funny film , home movie makes you crave chris smith 's next movie .
positive hey , who else needs a shower ?
positive children may not understand everything that happens -- i 'm not sure even miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated , and undoubtedly delighted .
negative a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact .
negative much of what is meant to be ` inspirational ' and ` uplifting ' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing -LSB- the movie 's -RSB- mindset .
negative no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest ` tron ' anderson , seems entirely improvised .

negative terrible .
positive poetic , heartbreaking .
negative -LSB- u -RSB- nrelentingly stupid .
negative while the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think .

negative it does n't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject .
positive not as good as the full monty , but a really strong second effort .
positive confessions may not be a straightforward bio , nor does it offer much in the way of barris ' motivations , but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture .
positive as the story moves inexorably through its seven day timeframe , the picture becomes increasingly mesmerizing .
positive parker holds true to wilde 's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness .
positive by applying definition to both sides of the man , the picture realizes a fullness that does not negate the subject .
positive solondz is so intent on hammering home his message that he forgets to make it entertaining .
positive it 's often infuriatingly glib and posturing , and yet it has been made with great evident care and manages to deliver up the man in a way to arouse further curiosity in even the most unknowing viewer .
negative stale , futile scenario .
negative pompous and garbled .
negative nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action flick .
positive ... an inviting piece of film .
negative ... a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman .
negative often likable , but just as often it 's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy .
negative simply a re-hash of the other seven films .
positive i 'll put it this way : if you 're in the mood for a melodrama narrated by talking fish , this is the movie for you .
positive all the actors are good in pauline & paulette but van der groen , described as ` belgium 's national treasure , ' is especially terrific as pauline .
positive in the new release of cinema paradiso , the tale has turned from sweet to bittersweet , and when the tears come during that final , beautiful scene , they finally feel absolutely earned .
positive for those who are intrigued by politics of the '70s , the film is every bit as fascinating as it is flawed .
negative it does n't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel .
negative a spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged .
positive an original gem about an obsession with time .
negative if all of eight legged freaks was as entertaining as the final hour , i would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation .
positive a pretty decent kid-pleasing , tolerable-to-adults lark of a movie .
negative de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal .
positive a good film with a solid pedigree both in front of and , more specifically , behind the camera .
negative '' abandon '' will leave you wanting to abandon the theater .
negative with nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , -LSB- crane -RSB- becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report .
positive if you can get past the fantastical aspects and harsh realities of '' the isle '' you 'll get a sock-you-in-the-eye flick that is a visual tour-de-force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere else .
negative fans of so-bad-they 're - good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess .
positive one of the most gloriously unsubtle and adrenalized extreme shockers since the evil dead .
positive griffin & co . manage to be spectacularly outrageous .
negative the jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail .
negative undercover brother does n't go far enough . it 's just a silly black genre spoof .
negative a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that 's pretty toxic in its own right .
positive though few will argue that it ranks with the best of herzog 's works , invincible shows he 's back in form , with an astoundingly rich film .
positive it 's one of the saddest films i have ever seen that still manages to be uplifting but not overly sentimental .
positive director lee has a true cinematic knack , but it 's also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly , unabashedly on its sleeve .
positive ` what 's the russian word for wow ! ? '
positive inside the film 's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it 's not that , it 's the tension that keeps you in your seat . affleck and jackson are good sparring partners .
negative feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work .
negative hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old 's suicidal poetry .
negative romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect .
negative one of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history .
negative her film is like a beautiful food entr e that is n't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless .
positive '' catch me '' feels capable of charming the masses with star power , a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a spielberg trademark .
positive -LSB- ferrera -RSB- has the charisma of a young woman who knows how to hold the screen .
positive it 's rare for any movie to be as subtle and touching as the son 's room .
negative it 's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense .
negative imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs .
positive -LSB- an -RSB- absorbing documentary .
positive ` divertida , enternecedora , universal y profundamente sincera , es una de las mejores comedias rom nticas en mucho tiempo . una verdadera delicia . '
negative a lousy movie that 's not merely unwatchable , but also unlistenable .
positive miyazaki is one of world cinema 's most wondrously gifted artists and storytellers .
negative the niftiest trick perpetrated by the importance of being earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of wilde into austen -- and a hollywood-ized austen at that .
negative the kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated .
positive you might not want to hang out with samantha , but you 'll probably see a bit of yourself in her unfinished story .
positive deep intelligence and a warm , enveloping affection breathe out of every frame .
negative snow dogs finds its humour in a black man getting humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than him
positive the emotions are raw and will strike a nerve with anyone who 's ever had family trauma .
positive andersson creates a world that 's at once surreal and disturbingly familiar ; absurd , yet tremendously sad .
negative eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm does n't do a load of good .
negative i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it 'll be on video by then .
negative if somebody was bored and ... decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus ' son , they 'd come up with something like bart freundlich 's world traveler .
negative the lousy lead performances ... keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired .
positive perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , about schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness .
negative the story 's pathetic and the gags are puerile .
positive halloween : resurrection is n't exactly quality cinema , but it is n't nearly as terrible as it cold have been .
positive it 's a solid movie about people whose lives are anything but .
negative some body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves .
positive it finds its moviegoing pleasures in the tiny events that could make a person who has lived her life half-asleep suddenly wake up and take notice .
negative the issue of faith is not explored very deeply
positive a warm , funny , engaging film .
positive this film is so different from the apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success .
negative it 's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story .
negative a collage of clich s and a dim echo of allusions to other films .
negative there 's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .
positive brings to a spectacular completion one of the most complex , generous and subversive artworks of the last decade .
negative has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags .
positive there 's a lot of tooth in roger dodger . but what 's nice is that there 's a casual intelligence that permeates the script .
negative supposedly authentic account of a historical event that 's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment .
negative will be far more interesting to the soderbergh faithful than it will be to the casual moviegoer who might be lured in by julia roberts ...
positive tsai convincingly paints a specifically urban sense of disassociation here .
positive you 'll laugh at either the obviousness of it all or its stupidity or maybe even its inventiveness , but the point is , you 'll laugh .
positive fisher has bared his soul and confronted his own shortcomings here in a way ... that feels very human and very true to life .
negative it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , '' look at this ! this is an interesting movie ! '' but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging .
positive 84 minutes of rolling musical back beat and supercharged cartoon warfare . it 's also , clearly , great fun .

positive hard , endearing , caring , warm . bring tissues .
positive reno himself can take credit for most of the movie 's success . he 's one of the few ` cool ' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness .

positive fans of critics ' darling band wilco will marvel at the sometimes murky , always brooding look of i am trying to break your heart .
positive kosminsky ... puts enough salt into the wounds of the tortured and self-conscious material to make it sting .
negative the marquis de sade could n't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be .
positive a photographic marvel of sorts , and it 's certainly an invaluable record of that special fishy community .
negative i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was .
negative with its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it 's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clich s .
negative you have no affinity for most of the characters . nothing about them is attractive . what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom .
negative buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clich s and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr . chips off the old block .

positive stone seems to have a knack for wrapping the theater in a cold blanket of urban desperation .
negative even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity did n't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary 's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest .

negative feels slight , as if it were an extended short , albeit one made by the smartest kids in class .
positive it 's a wise and powerful tale of race and culture forcefully told , with superb performances throughout .
negative the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years .
negative although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film 's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks .
positive this often-hilarious farce manages to generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its high-minded appeal .
negative screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice 's complex akasha into a cartoon monster .

negative plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king .
positive cho continues her exploration of the outer limits of raunch with considerable brio .
negative there are plenty of scenes in frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself .

positive in the end , punch-drunk love is one of those films that i wanted to like much more than i actually did . sometimes , that 's enough .
positive far more imaginative and ambitious than the trivial , cash-in features nickelodeon has made from its other animated tv series .
negative the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington 's fine performance in the title role .
positive at once subtle and visceral , the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful , offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future .

negative a yawn-provoking little farm melodrama .
positive if the first men in black was money , the second is small change . but it still jingles in the pocket . it 's fun lite .
negative for a film about explosions and death and spies , '' ballistic : ecks vs . sever '' seems as safe as a children 's film . well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies .
negative the director 's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that 's low on both suspense and payoff .
negative the film starts promisingly , but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work .
positive with a romantic comedy plotline straight from the ages , this cinderella story does n't have a single surprise up its sleeve . but it does somehow manage to get you under its spell .

positive a pure participatory event that malnourished intellectuals will gulp down in a frenzy .
positive the film 's appeal has a lot to do with the casting of juliette binoche as sand , who brings to the role her pale , dark beauty and characteristic warmth .
positive this charming , thought-provoking new york fest of life and love has its rewards .
negative wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly -LRB- like one of hubert 's punches -RRB- , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn .
negative apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths . marisa tomei is good , but just a kiss is just a mess .

positive smart , provocative and blisteringly funny .
negative very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .

positive frequent flurries of creative belly laughs and genuinely enthusiastic performances ... keep the movie slaloming through its hackneyed elements with enjoyable ease .

positive one of the most genuinely sweet films to come along in quite some time .
positive i am not generally a huge fan of cartoons derived from tv shows , but hey arnold ! the movie is clever , offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance .
negative the thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes -LRB- of which they 'll get plenty -RRB- fills me with revulsion .
negative not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at .
negative for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear .
positive steve irwin 's method is ernest hemmingway at accelerated speed and volume .

positive jackie chan movies are a guilty pleasure - he 's easy to like and always leaves us laughing .
positive i 'm sure mainstream audiences will be baffled , but , for those with at least a minimal appreciation of woolf and clarissa dalloway , the hours represents two of those well spent .
negative what we get in feardotcom is more like something from a bad clive barker movie . in other words , it 's badder than bad .
negative the vintage is pure '87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = do n't have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = do n't if you 're married to one .
negative disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material .
positive like its bizarre heroine , it irrigates our souls .
negative swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit . or intelligent .
positive the film is exhilarating to watch because sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor .
negative a not-so-divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood with a hefty helping of re-fried green tomatoes .
negative a boring , pretentious muddle that uses a sensational , real-life 19th-century crime as a metaphor for -- well , i 'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop .

negative harrison 's flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all .

positive a fun ride .
positive family fare .
negative what starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points .
positive while it has definite weaknesses -- like a rather unbelievable love interest and a meandering ending -- this '60s caper film is a riveting , brisk delight .
negative reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film .
negative the actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus .
positive woven together handsomely , recalling sixties ' rockumentary milestones from lonely boy to do n't look back .
negative it jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding m tier .
positive a worthy tribute to a great humanitarian and her vibrant ` co-stars . '

negative it 's obvious -LSB- je-gyu is -RSB- trying for poetry ; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom .
negative trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the '' gadzooks ! ''
negative this toothless dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen .
positive one hour photo may seem disappointing in its generalities , but it 's the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director mark romanek 's self-conscious scrutiny to happen , that finally get under your skin .
negative ritchie 's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller 's polemical allegory , but it 's self-defeatingly decorous .
positive this is n't exactly profound cinema , but it 's good-natured and sometimes quite funny .
positive what lifts the film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map .
positive bielinsky is a filmmaker of impressive talent .
positive lee 's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that brown played in american culture as an athlete , a movie star , and an image of black indomitability .
positive there 's something to be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers .
positive it 's soulful and unslick , and that 's apparently just what -LSB- aniston -RSB- has always needed to grow into a movie career .
positive nolan proves that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure .
negative diane lane shines in unfaithful . almost everything else is wan .
negative the exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors .
positive a vivid , spicy footnote to history , and a movie that grips and holds you in rapt attention from start to finish .

positive nothing denis has made before , like beau travil and nenette et boni , could prepare us for this gory , perverted , sex-soaked riff on the cannibal genre .
negative it 's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly .
positive a powerful and telling story that examines forbidden love , racial tension , and other issues that are as valid today as they were in the 1950s .
negative there is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down . and that should tell you everything you need to know about all the queen 's men .

negative this is standard crime drama fare ... instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull .
negative the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film .

positive foster nails the role , giving a tight , focused performance illuminated by shards of feeling .
negative it 's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish . not only is entry number twenty the worst of the brosnan bunch , it 's one of the worst of the entire franchise .
positive alternating between facetious comic parody and pulp melodrama , this smart-aleck movie ... tosses around some intriguing questions about the difference between human and android life .
positive a taut psychological thriller that does n't waste a moment of its two-hour running time .
negative obstacles are too easily overcome and there is n't much in the way of character development in the script .
negative this is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm .
positive the primitive force of this film seems to bubble up from the vast collective memory of the combatants . it 's like watching a nightmare made flesh .

negative except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby 's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion .
positive in its own floundering way , it gets to you . just like igby .
negative this overproduced and generally disappointing effort is n't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd .
negative return to never land is much more p . c . than the original version -LRB- no more racist portraits of indians , for instance -RRB- , but the excitement is missing .
negative busy urban comedy is clearly not zhang 's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy .
positive sensual , funny and , in the end , very touching .
positive turns potentially forgettable formula into something strangely diverting .
positive one of the most important and exhilarating forms of animated filmmaking since old walt doodled steamboat willie .

positive -LSB- sports -RSB- admirable energy , full-bodied characterizations and narrative urgency .
positive all in all , an interesting look at the life of the campaign-trail press , especially ones that do n't really care for the candidate they 're forced to follow .
positive this is so de palma . if you love him , you 'll like it . if you do n't ... well , skip to another review .
negative first-time director jo o pedro rodrigues ' unwillingness to define his hero 's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on .
negative the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .
positive after watching it , you can only love the players it brings to the fore for the gifted but no-nonsense human beings they are and for the still-inestimable contribution they have made to our shared history .
positive deliciously mean-spirited and wryly observant .
positive the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes .
positive the one-liners are snappy , the situations volatile and the comic opportunities richly rewarded .
positive with exquisite craftsmanship ... olivier assayas has fashioned an absorbing look at provincial bourgeois french society .
negative with this new rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment .
positive if you can tolerate the redneck-versus-blueblood cliches that the film trades in , sweet home alabama is diverting in the manner of jeff foxworthy 's stand-up act .
negative adam sandler 's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt
positive oddly compelling .
positive you may leave the theater with more questions than answers , but darned if your toes wo n't still be tapping .
negative give shapiro , goldman , and bolado credit for good intentions , but there 's nothing here that they could n't have done in half an hour .

negative when ` science fiction ' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience has n't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre .
negative sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip .
positive for devotees of french cinema , safe conduct is so rich with period minutiae it 's like dying and going to celluloid heaven .
positive ` film aficionados can not help but love cinema paradiso , whether the original version or new director 's cut . '
positive they 're just a couple of cops in copmovieland , these two , but in narc , they find new routes through a familiar neighborhood .
positive the whole mildly pleasant outing -- the r rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse -- remains aloft not on its own self-referential hot air , but on the inspired performance of tim allen .
negative the problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum . a rumor of angels does n't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness .
negative fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor .
negative when a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that 's a bad sign . a very bad sign .
positive if i have to choose between gorgeous animation and a lame story -LRB- like , say , treasure planet -RRB- or so-so animation and an exciting , clever story with a batch of appealing characters , i 'll take the latter every time .
negative there 's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids ' movie ... that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups .
negative it is too bad that this likable movie is n't more accomplished . the actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward .
positive what makes how i killed my father compelling , besides its terrific performances , is fontaine 's willingness to wander into the dark areas of parent-child relationships without flinching .
positive max pokes , provokes , takes expressionistic license and hits a nerve ... as far as art is concerned , it 's mission accomplished .
negative the ch teau would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera . not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens .
negative in the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds . right now , they 're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination .
negative in the second half of the film , frei 's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis .
negative the furious coherence that -LSB- deniro -RSB- brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing .
positive the magic of the film lies not in the mysterious spring but in the richness of its performances .

negative -LSB- seems -RSB- even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels .
positive this charming but slight tale has warmth , wit and interesting characters compassionately portrayed .

negative first good , then bothersome . excellent acting and direction .
negative it 's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here 's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role .
positive a triumph of art direction over narrative , but what art direction !
positive maintains your interest until the end and even leaves you with a few lingering animated thoughts .
negative the connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice .
negative there are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them .
negative alternately frustrating and rewarding .

negative it believes it 's revealing some great human truths , when , in reality , it 's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile .

negative the only entertainment you 'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles several of them .
positive less an examination of neo-nazism than a probe into the nature of faith itself .
negative the story of trouble every day ... is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie 's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult .
negative there 's not enough here to justify the almost two hours .

negative the most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 miles to graceland .
positive the second coming of harry potter is a film far superior to its predecessor . a movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the godzilla sized soda .
positive the movie 's seams may show ... but pellington gives '' mothman '' an irresistibly uncanny ambience that goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling .

negative to my taste , the film 's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation .
positive shamelessly resorting to pee-related sight gags that might even cause tom green a grimace ; still , myer 's energy and the silliness of it all eventually prevail
positive anchored by friel and williams 's exceptional performances , the film 's power lies in its complexity . nothing is black and white .
positive the movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate/surf culture , the l . a . beach scene and the imaginative -LRB- and sometimes illegal -RRB- ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults .
positive a film of delicate interpersonal dances . caine makes us watch as his character awakens to the notion that to be human is eventually to have to choose . it 's a sight to behold .
negative the impulses that produced this project ... are commendable , but the results are uneven .
negative no matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way .
negative nothing about it fits .
negative the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i 'd care to count .
positive the entire cast is extraordinarily good .
positive a wonderfully speculative character study that made up for its rather slow beginning by drawing me into the picture .

negative no matter how firmly director john stainton has his tongue in his cheek , the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make .
negative is n't it a bit early in his career for director barry sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ? and it 's a lousy one at that .
negative the pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie 's final scenes .
positive jaglom ... put -LSB- s -RSB- the audience in the privileged position of eavesdropping on his characters

positive it 's still adam sandler , and it 's not little nicky . and for many of us , that 's good enough .
negative though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch .
positive the best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , and bertrand tavernier 's oft-brilliant safe conduct -LRB- '' laissez-passer '' -RRB- wears its heart on its sleeve .
positive the audacity to view one of shakespeare 's better known tragedies as a dark comedy is , by itself , deserving of discussion .
negative i like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they 're treading water at best in this forgettable effort .
negative if it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in dolby digital stereo . if nothing else , '' rollerball '' 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j .
negative an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .
negative even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission 's worth of funny to keep it afloat .
positive a captivating new film .
negative this movie is so bad , that it 's almost worth seeing because it 's so bad .
positive full of detail about the man and his country , and is well worth seeing .
positive for the first time in years , de niro digs deep emotionally , perhaps because he 's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars .
negative cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed .
negative if you 're a wwf fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in a . i . , you 'll probably like rollerball .
negative the ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch .
negative holland lets things peter out midway , but it 's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .
negative the most horrific movie experience i 've had since '' ca n't stop the music . '' it may as well be called '' jar-jar binks : the movie . '' it 's that painful .
negative a great ensemble cast ca n't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar .

positive it 's never laugh-out-loud funny , but it is frequently amusing .

negative schaefer 's ... determination to inject farcical raunch ... drowns out the promise of the romantic angle .
negative co-writer/director jonathan parker 's attempts to fashion a brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short .

positive piccoli gives a superb performance full of deep feeling .
positive an enjoyable film for the family , amusing and cute for both adults and kids .
positive austin powers in goldmember is a cinematic car wreck , a catastrophic collision of tastelessness and gall that nevertheless will leave fans clamoring for another ride .
positive a muckraking job , the cinematic equivalent of a legal indictment , and a fairly effective one at that .
negative it 's the funniest american comedy since graffiti bridge .
negative well , jason 's gone to manhattan and hell , i guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels -LRB- hey , do n't shoot the messenger -RRB- .
positive enriched by a strong and unforced supporting cast .
positive fuller would surely have called this gutsy and at times exhilarating movie a great yarn .
positive full of profound , real-life moments that anyone can relate to , it deserves a wide audience .

positive from both a great and a terrible story , mr . nelson has made a film that is an undeniably worthy and devastating experience .
positive an imaginative comedy/thriller .
negative it 's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another .
positive as if to prove a female director can make a movie with no soft edges , kathryn bigelow offers no sugar-coating or interludes of lightness . her film is unrelentingly claustrophobic and unpleasant .
positive like the rugrats movies , the wild thornberrys movie does n't offer much more than the series , but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome .
negative a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really does n't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird .
positive scherfig 's light-hearted profile of emotional desperation is achingly honest and delightfully cheeky .
positive like a south-of-the-border melrose place .
positive a sly female empowerment movie , although not in a way anyone would expect .
positive more intimate than spectacular , e . t . is carried less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades .
positive the imax screen enhances the personal touch of manual animation .
negative presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable .

negative even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame .
negative a plodding look at the french revolution through the eyes of aristocrats .

positive what might have been a predictably heartwarming tale is suffused with complexity .
negative one scene after another in this supposedly funny movie falls to the floor with a sickening thud .
negative while the film is competent , it 's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires .

positive it 's absolutely spooky how lillard channels the shagster right down to the original casey kasem-furnished voice .

negative what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama .
negative less than fresh .

negative a tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .
positive though the film never veers from its comic course , its unintentional parallels might inadvertently evoke memories and emotions which are anything but humorous .
negative at some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill .
negative everything about girls ca n't swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way .
negative predictably melodramatic .
negative just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing .
negative laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it 's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters .
negative coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock .
negative the kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books .
positive rehearsals are frequently more fascinating than the results . last dance , whatever its flaws , fulfills one facet of its mission in making me want to find out whether , in this case , that 's true .
negative the only thing to fear about '' fear dot com '' is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film .

positive the performances of the four main actresses bring their characters to life . a little melodramatic , but with enough hope to keep you engaged .

negative feels like a cold old man going through the motions .
negative sex with strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness . but what is missing from it all is a moral . what is the filmmakers ' point ? why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ?

negative this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it 's a tad slow .

negative as his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in long time dead says ` i 'm telling you , this is f * * * ed ' . maybe he was reading the minds of the audience .
positive boisterous and daft documentary .
negative who is this movie for ? not kids , who do n't need the lesson in repugnance . it 's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are ` edgy . '
negative mildly entertaining .
positive evelyn 's strong cast and surehanded direction make for a winning , heartwarming yarn .
negative it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did .
negative unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , harvard man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic .
negative this thing is just garbage .
positive the last scenes of the film are anguished , bitter and truthful . mr . koshashvili is a director to watch .

positive adaptation 's success in engaging the audience in the travails of creating a screenplay is extraordinary .
positive drug abuse , infidelity and death are n't usually comedy fare , but turpin 's film allows us to chuckle through the angst .

negative fairly run-of-the-mill .
negative -LSB- director -RSB- o'fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short .
positive a bold and subversive film that cuts across the grain of what is popular and powerful in this high-tech age , speaking its truths with spellbinding imagery and the entrancing music of philip glass .
positive more than anything else , kissing jessica stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again .
negative plays like some corny television production from a bygone era
positive entirely suspenseful , extremely well-paced and ultimately ... dare i say , entertaining !
negative the movie 's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story . killing time , that 's all that 's going on here .
positive even as it pays earnest homage to turntablists and beat jugglers , old schoolers and current innovators , scratch is great fun , full of the kind of energy it 's documenting .
negative perry 's good and his is an interesting character , but '' serving sara '' has n't much more to serve than silly fluff . nor is it a romantic comedy .
negative the last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others ' affections .
negative the animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication .
positive the most brilliant and brutal uk crime film since jack carter went back to newcastle , the first half of gangster no . 1 drips with style and , at times , blood .
positive if a horror movie 's primary goal is to frighten and disturb , then they works spectacularly well ... a shiver-inducing , nerve-rattling ride .
