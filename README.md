# StatNLP-PyTorch (V0.1)
The PyTorch version of StatNLP implementation V0.1. Please also make sure you understand the fundamental knowledge of the framework as well as the [Java framework](https://gitlab.com/sutd_nlp/statnlp-core).
* [1. Requirements and Installation](#requirements-and-installation)
* [2. Implementation Tutorials](#implementation-tutorials)
* [3. Examples](#examples)

## Requirements and Installation
The project is based on PyTorch 0.4+ and Python 3.5+.

We plan to upload our framework to Pypi where you can use the framework by simply typing `pip install`. But at the moment, what you can do is:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/leodotnet/statnlp-neural
```
Build your neural graphical model under this code base, this also allows you to modify the code to adjust your own project.



## Implementation Tutorials

Get your hands dirty with StatNLP! If you are not familiar with the fundamental theory of StatNLP, check out our [EMNLP 2017 tutorial on structured prediction](http://www.statnlp.org/tutorials).
The code for the complete implementation tutorial is under `examples/linear_ner/`.

Follow the tutorials below to build your model.
1. [Basics: load data into instances](/docs/basics.md)
2. [Graphical Model: build customized graphical model](/docs/graphs.md)
3. [Neural Network: design neural network](/docs/neural.md)
4. [Run the model!](/docs/run.md)

## Examples
We have built some existing models with this framework for your references:
* [Linear CRF for Named Entity Recognition](/statnlp/examples/linearner.py)
* [Semi-Markov CRF for NP Chunking](/statnlp/examples/seminer.py)
* [CNN for Text Classification](/statnlp/examples/me_standard.py)
* [Constituency Parsing CRF Model](/statnlp/examples/parsingtree.py)
  * Download the [evaluation file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E58DGwlS3x3n5IZpNXW_l2PNZUYLNo3P/view?usp=sharing) (for parsing) and put it under project folder.
